Complex Document for RAG Parsing Tests
Synthetic 15-page PDF with paragraphs, simple and complex tables, diagrams, scanned-form style image, metadata
examples, and production RAG edge cases.
Story Line
Three client teams - Arka Finance, BlueLeaf Retail, and CityRide Mobility - are migrating contracts, policies, support records,
and operational reports into a single RAG platform. Each team has different document types, access rules, and parsing
challenges. The RAG system must answer questions with citations while ensuring that one client never sees another clients
data.
This PDF is intentionally designed to test document loaders, PDF parsers, OCR workflows, table extraction, chunking
strategies, metadata preservation, and source citation quality.
Key statement: RAG does not train the model. RAG gives the model the right context before answering.

1. Business Scenario
The platform team is building a document intelligence layer for contract operations. Legal users need answers such as: Which
contracts renew automatically? Which agreements have a 60-day termination notice? Which documents mention data
residency in India? These questions require retrieval across multiple document types and sometimes across multiple related
documents of a single client.
Support teams also want answers from SOPs, markdown runbooks, HTML exports, chat transcripts, and CSV logs. A single
parser is not enough because the corpus contains born-digital PDFs, scanned forms, HTML, markdown, and spreadsheet-like
tables.

Clause 7.2 - Confidential Information. The Receiving Party shall protect Confidential Information using at least the same

Information includes technical documents, pricing schedules, user lists, API keys, operational procedures, security reports,
incident response notes, product roadmaps, and any derived analysis prepared by the Receiving Party.
Clause 7.3 - Exclusions. Confidential Information does not include information that is publicly available without breach,
independently developed without reference to the Disclosing Party material, received lawfully from a third party, or approved
for release in writing. The burden of proving an exclusion remains with the Receiving Party.
Clause 9.1 - Data Residency. If the Statement of Work identifies a specific processing region, the service provider shall
process production records only within that region unless the client approves a transfer in writing. Disaster recovery replicas
may be stored in a secondary region if encryption at rest and access logging are enabled.
Clause 11.4 - Termination Assistance. Upon termination, the provider shall make client data available for export for a period
of thirty days. After the export period, the provider may delete production data according to the deletion schedule unless a

7. Markdown Runbook Excerpt
Markdown files are often easier to parse because headings and code blocks are explicit. However, when markdown is
exported to PDF, the structure may become visual rather than semantic.
# Runbook: Contract Ingestion Failure
## Symptoms
- Upload status remains `processing` for more than 30 minutes.
- Worker logs show repeated timeout errors.
- Vector count does not increase for the affected document.
## Recovery Steps
1. Confirm the object exists in document storage.
2. Re-run parser with `safe_mode=True`.
3. Rebuild chunks with the previous chunking configuration.
4. Compare chunk count with the last successful ingestion.
5. Trigger re-embedding only for changed chunks.
A good parser should preserve code block boundaries and avoid mixing numbered steps with surrounding prose. In RAG,
runbooks are useful because users often ask operational questions that require exact steps.

content, captions, image metadata, and surrounding text. Text-only loaders may extract the caption but cannot
understand the visual content unless OCR, vision, or multimodal parsing is used.
